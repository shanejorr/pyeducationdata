# Urban Institute Education Data Portal API: Complete Tutorial

The Urban Institute's Education Data Portal API provides comprehensive access to decades of US education data from kindergarten through postsecondary education. This open, free-to-use API aggregates data from multiple federal sources into a unified, standardized interface.

## Overview and getting started

The Education Data Portal API is a **REST-based API** built on Django REST Framework that returns data in **JSON format**. The API requires **no authentication, registration, or API keys**â€”all endpoints are publicly accessible. Data is licensed under the **Open Data Commons Attribution License (ODC-By) v1.0**, requiring proper attribution when used.

**Base URL:** `https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/`

**Official Documentation:** https://educationdata.urban.org/documentation/

**Technical specifications:**
- Response format: JSON (all endpoints)
- API version: v1 (current)
- Data portal version: 0.23.0
- Technology: Django REST Framework with PostgreSQL database
- No special requirements beyond standard HTTP capabilities

## API structure and architecture

All API requests follow a hierarchical URL structure with consistent patterns across endpoints:

```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/{level}/{source}/{topic}/{year}/[specifiers]/[filters]
```

**URL components:**
- **level**: Geographic/institutional level (schools, school-districts, college-university)
- **source**: Data source (ccd, crdc, ipeds, edfacts, saipe, scorecard, etc.)
- **topic**: Specific dataset (directory, enrollment, finance, etc.)
- **year**: Academic year (required for most endpoints)
- **specifiers**: Optional disaggregation parameters (grade, race, sex combinations)
- **filters**: Query string parameters for filtering results

**Example URLs:**
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/2013/grade-3/?charter=1&fips=11
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/college-university/ipeds/directory/2023/
```

The API organizes education data into three main levels, each containing data from multiple federal sources.

## Complete list of API endpoints

The Education Data Portal includes approximately **160+ unique data endpoints** across all three institutional levels.

https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/college-university/ipeds/directory/2023/
```

### Grade values for K-12 endpoints

When endpoints require grade specifiers, use these values:

- `grade-pk` - Pre-kindergarten
- `grade-1` through `grade-12` - Individual grades
- `grade-13` - Grade 13 (rare)
- `grade-14` - Adult education
- `grade-15` - Ungraded students
- `grade-16` - K-12 total
- `grade-20` - Grades 7-8 combined
- `grade-21` - Grades 9-10 combined
- `grade-22` - Grades 11-12 combined
- `grade-99` - Total all grades

### Level of study values for college endpoints

For IPEDS endpoints requiring level of study:
- `undergraduate` - Undergraduate students
- `graduate` - Graduate students
- `first-professional` - First-professional (law, medicine, etc.)
- Specific values vary by endpoint; check documentation

## Filtering data

### Filter syntax

Add filters as query string parameters at the end of URLs:

```
?filter_variable=value
```

**Single filter example:**
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020?fips=17
```

### Common filter variables

**Geographic filters:**
- `fips` - State FIPS code (e.g., `17` for Illinois, `11` for DC, `6` for California)
- `leaid` - District ID
- `ncessch` - School ID
- `unitid` - College/university IPEDS ID

**Institutional filters:**
- `school_level` - School level code (e.g., `1` for primary, `2` for middle, `3` for high school)
- `charter` - Charter school indicator (`1` for charter, `0` for non-charter)
- `grade` - Grade level
- `race` - Race/ethnicity code
- `sex` - Sex/gender code

**Important:** Available filters vary by endpoint. Check the documentation for each endpoint to see which filters are supported.

### Multiple filter values

Use comma-separated values to match any of the specified values (OR logic):

```
?fips=17,55
?year=2018,2019,2020
?grade=9,10,11,12
```

**Example:**
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020?fips=17,55
```
Returns schools in Illinois (17) OR Wisconsin (55).

### Combining multiple filters

Use ampersand (`&`) to combine multiple filters (AND logic):

```
?filter1=value1&filter2=value2
```

**Examples:**

Charter schools in DC:
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/2013/grade-3/?charter=1&fips=11
```

High schools in Illinois:
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020?school_level=3&fips=17
```

Multiple states and years:
```
?fips=17,55&year=2018,2019,2020
```

**Filter combination logic:**
- Multiple filters with `&` use AND logic (all conditions must be met)
- Multiple values within a filter (comma-separated) use OR logic (any value matches)
- Example: `?fips=17,55&charter=1` means (Illinois OR Wisconsin) AND (charter schools)

### Filtering limitations

**Important filtering constraints:**

1. **Equality-based filtering only** - The API supports only exact matches. There are NO comparison operators like greater than (>), less than (<), not equals (!=), etc.

2. **Endpoint-specific filters** - Only variables listed as filters in the documentation for each endpoint can be used for filtering. Not all variables are filterable.

3. **No custom sorting** - The API does not support sort or order_by parameters. Results are returned in the database's natural order.

4. **Range queries** - For ranges (like multiple years), you must specify all values explicitly using comma-separated format:
   ```
   ?year=2018,2019,2020
   ```
   You cannot use expressions like `year>=2018`.

### Summary endpoint queries

Summary endpoints provide aggregated statistics without downloading raw data:

**Format:**
```
/api/v1/{level}/{source}/{topic}/summaries?var={variable}&stat={statistic}&by={grouping}
```

**Parameters:**
- `var` - Variable to summarize (must be numeric, non-filter variable)
- `stat` - Statistic to calculate (sum, count, avg, min, max, variance, stddev, median)
- `by` - Grouping variable(s), comma-separated for multiple dimensions

**Additional filters can be added using standard filter syntax.**

**Examples:**

Sum of enrollment by state:
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/summaries?var=enrollment&stat=sum&by=fips
```

Average enrollment by school level:
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/summaries?var=enrollment&stat=avg&by=school_level
```

With filters - sum of enrollment by sex for California, limited to specific races:
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/summaries?var=enrollment&stat=sum&by=sex&fips=6&race=1,2
```

Multiple grouping dimensions:
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/summaries?var=enrollment&stat=sum&by=fips,race&fips=17,55&year=2018,2019,2020
```

**Benefits of summary endpoints:**
- Orders of magnitude faster than downloading and aggregating raw data
- Pre-joined with directory data, allowing grouping by variables not in the original endpoint
- Reduces data transfer and processing time
- Ideal for dashboards, visualizations, and quick analyses

## Authentication and rate limits

### Authentication requirements

**No authentication required.** The Education Data Portal API is completely open and public:

- No API keys needed
- No registration required
- No authentication tokens
- No login credentials
- Direct access to all endpoints via URL

You can access all data directly in a web browser or through programmatic requests without any authentication mechanism.

### Rate limits and throttling

**Primary rate limit:** 10,000 records per page maximum

**Details:**
- The API limits responses to 10,000 records per page to prevent large requests from degrading performance for other users
- When results exceed 10,000 records, pagination is required (see Pagination section)
- No explicit request-rate limits (requests per minute/hour) are documented
- The primary constraint is the per-page record limit rather than request frequency

**Performance characteristics:**
- 95% of data requests returned within 30 seconds
- 90% of data requests returned within 10 seconds
- 75% of data requests returned within 2 seconds
- 90%+ of requests served from cache

## API response structure

### Standard response format

All API endpoints return JSON-formatted responses with a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "results": [ /* array of data records */ ],
  "next": "URL to next page or null"
}
```

**Response components:**

**`results`** - Array containing the actual data records:
- Up to 10,000 records per page
- Each record is a JSON object with field-value pairs
- Fields vary by endpoint

**`next`** - URL to retrieve the next page:
- String containing full URL to next page if more results exist
- `null` if on the last page of results

### Example responses

**School directory request:**
```
URL: https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/
```

Response structure:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "year": 2020,
      "ncessch": "010000100277",
      "school_name": "Example Elementary School",
      "fips": 1,
      "school_level": 1,
      "charter": 0,
      "latitude": 32.3456,
      "longitude": -86.2345
      // ... additional fields
    }
    // ... up to 10,000 records
  ],
  "next": "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/?page=2"
}
```

**Summary endpoint response:**
```
URL: https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/summaries?var=enrollment&stat=sum&by=fips&year=2020
```

Response structure:
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "fips": 1,
      "year": 2020,
      "enrollment": 754123
    },
    {
      "fips": 2,
      "year": 2020,
      "enrollment": 132104
    }
    // ... one record per state
  ]
}
```

### Data record structure

Each record in the `results` array contains:

**Identifier fields:**
- `year` - Academic year
- `ncessch` - School ID (12-digit)
- `leaid` - District ID (7-digit)
- `unitid` - College/university ID
- `fips` - State FIPS code

**Data fields specific to the endpoint:**
- Numeric values (enrollment counts, revenue amounts, test scores, etc.)
- Categorical values (school types, grade levels, race codes, etc.)
- Text fields (names, addresses)
- Geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)

**Special values:**
- `-1` typically indicates missing data
- `-2` typically indicates not applicable
- `-3` may indicate suppressed for privacy
- Check endpoint-specific documentation for special value meanings

### Metadata endpoint responses

Metadata endpoints return information about the API structure:

**`/api/v1/api-endpoints/`** - Lists all available endpoints:
- Endpoint IDs
- Endpoint URLs
- Years available
- Descriptions

**`/api/v1/api-variables/`** - Lists all variables:
- Variable names
- Data types
- Formats
- Labels and descriptions
- Special value codes

**`/api/v1/api-endpoint-varlist/`** - Variables by endpoint:
- Which variables are available for each endpoint
- Required vs. optional variables

**`/api/v1/api-downloads/`** - CSV downloads and codebooks:
- Direct download URLs
- Codebook links (Excel format)
- File sizes and descriptions

### Pagination

**Pagination is automatic and transparent:**

When results exceed 10,000 records:
1. First request returns up to 10,000 records plus a `next` URL
2. Continue requesting the `next` URL to retrieve subsequent pages
3. `next` becomes `null` when no more pages remain

**Implementing pagination:**

Python example:
```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

url = "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/"
response = requests.get(url).json()
data = response["results"]

# Loop through remaining pages
while response["next"]:
    response = requests.get(response["next"]).json()
    data.extend(response["results"])

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

JavaScript example:
```javascript
let url = "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/"
let data = []

const getData = async (url) => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const json = await response.json();
  data = data.concat(json.results);
  
  if (json.next) {
    await getData(json.next);
  }
}

getData(url)
```

**Note:** The official R and Stata packages automatically handle pagination, so users of those tools don't need to implement manual pagination logic.

### Error handling

While specific error response formats aren't fully documented, follow these best practices:

**Check for expected response structure:**
```python
response = requests.get(url)
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    if "results" in data:
        # Process results
    else:
        # Handle unexpected response structure
else:
    # Handle HTTP error
```

**Handle missing data:**
- Empty `results` arrays indicate no matching records
- Check for special values (-1, -2, -3) in numeric fields
- Validate that required fields are present

**Common issues:**
- Invalid endpoint URLs (incorrect path components)
- Missing required specifiers (e.g., grade for enrollment endpoints)
- Invalid filter values
- Database query timeouts for very large, unoptimized requests

## Best practices for using the API

### Performance optimization strategies

**1. Use main filters effectively**

Apply filters at the API level rather than downloading all data and filtering locally:

Efficient:
```
/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020?fips=17&school_level=3
```

Inefficient:
```
/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/
(then filtering locally for Illinois high schools)
```

**Main filters** (year, fips, ncessch, leaid, unitid, grade) are indexed and provide the fastest queries.

**2. Leverage summary endpoints**

For aggregated statistics, summary endpoints are orders of magnitude faster than pulling raw records:

Fast summary query:
```
/api/v1/schools/ccd/enrollment/summaries?var=enrollment&stat=sum&by=fips,race
```

Versus downloading millions of school-level records and aggregating locally.

**3. Use CSV downloads for large datasets**

For complete datasets spanning multiple years:
- CSV downloads are significantly faster than paginating through API results
- Access via: `https://educationdata.urban.org/csv/{file_dir}/{file_name}`
- Available in documentation under "Downloads" tab
- Single CSV may cover multiple years
- May require post-download filtering

**Trade-off:** CSV is faster for full datasets but slower for small, filtered subsets. Use the API for targeted queries, CSV for comprehensive downloads.

**4. Specify multiple values efficiently**

Use comma-separated values in a single filter:
```
?fips=17,55&year=2018,2019,2020
```

Rather than making separate requests for each value.

**5. Take advantage of caching**

The API implements aggressive caching:
- Identical requests return much faster (served from cache)
- 90%+ of requests served from cache
- Query parameter order doesn't affect caching (URLs are normalized)

**6. Request only necessary data**

- Use appropriate endpoint granularity (don't request school-level data if district-level suffices)
- Apply filters to reduce result size
- Use summary endpoints when aggregated statistics meet your needs

### Data retrieval guidelines

**1. Check data availability first**

Use metadata endpoints to verify data availability:
```python
metadata_url = "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/api-endpoints/"
payload = {"endpoint_id": 24}
response = requests.get(metadata_url, params=payload).json()
latest_year = response["results"][0]["years_available"][-4:]
```

**2. Implement proper pagination**

Always handle pagination for large result sets:
- Check for `next` field in responses
- Continue requesting until `next` is `null`
- Or use R/Stata packages that handle pagination automatically

**3. Validate data quality**

- Check for special values indicating missing data (-1, -2, -3)
- Validate that required fields are present
- Be aware of privacy suppressions in CRDC and EdFacts data
- Consider COVID-19 data quality issues for 2019-20 and 2020-21

**4. Handle temporal changes**

- School and district boundaries change over time; IDs may not be stable across all years
- CRDC is biennial (collected every other year)
- Check years available for each endpoint
- Be aware of gaps in data collection

### Programming language implementations

**R Package (recommended for R users):**
```r
install.packages("educationdata")
library(educationdata)

# Get data with automatic pagination
df <- get_education_data(
  level = "schools",
  source = "ccd",
  topic = "directory",
  filters = list(year = 2020, fips = 17),
  add_labels = TRUE
)
```

**Stata Package (recommended for Stata users):**
```stata
ssc install educationdata
ssc install libjson

educationdata using "schools ccd directory", ///
  sub(year=2020 fips=17) clear
```

**Python (using requests library):**
```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

url = "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/"
params = {"fips": 17, "school_level": 3}
response = requests.get(url, params=params).json()

data = response["results"]
while response["next"]:
    response = requests.get(response["next"]).json()
    data.extend(response["results"])

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

**JavaScript (using fetch):**
```javascript
const url = "https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/schools/ccd/directory/2020/?fips=17";

fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data.results);
    // Handle pagination if needed
    if (data.next) {
      // fetch data.next
    }
  });
```

### Common pitfalls to avoid

**1. Not handling pagination**
- Assuming all data arrives in the first response
- Solution: Always check for and follow `next` URLs

**2. Ignoring the 10,000 record limit**
- Expecting unlimited results per page
- Solution: Implement proper pagination loops

**3. Using API for massive bulk downloads**
- Pulling gigabytes of data via paginated API calls
- Solution: Use CSV downloads for large comprehensive datasets (8+ GB)

**4. Inefficient filtering**
- Downloading all data and filtering locally
- Solution: Use API query parameters to filter at source

**5. Missing required specifiers**
- Some endpoints require grade, level of study, or other path parameters
- Solution: Check documentation "Example Request" tab for required components

**6. Not utilizing summary endpoints**
- Computing aggregations on millions of raw records locally
- Solution: Use `/summaries` endpoints with appropriate statistics

**7. Assuming stable identifiers across time**
- School and district IDs can change as boundaries shift
- Solution: Use multiple identifiers (name, location) to track entities over time

**8. Ignoring data quality caveats**
- EdFacts data uses "fuzzing" for privacy, introducing measurement error
- CRDC small cell sizes may be suppressed
- COVID-19 impacts on 2019-20 and 2020-21 data
- Solution: Read data quality notes in source documentation

**9. Not checking endpoint-specific filters**
- Assuming all variables can be filtered
- Solution: Check documentation for each endpoint's available filters

**10. Bypassing cache unnecessarily**
- Making identical requests with different parameter orders
- Note: API now normalizes URLs, but use consistent formatting

### Tips for specific use cases

**Building dashboards and visualizations:**
- Use summary endpoints for real-time aggregations
- Cache results on your end to reduce API calls
- Monitor response times and optimize queries
- Consider pre-loading data via CSV for static visualizations

**Research and analysis:**
- Download complete datasets via CSV for comprehensive analysis
- Use API for exploratory queries and data validation
- Leverage R or Stata packages for simplified workflows
- Document exact API queries/versions for reproducibility

**Data pipelines and automation:**
- Use metadata endpoints to programmatically discover available years
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Schedule large downloads during off-peak hours
- Store downloaded data locally to minimize repeated API calls

**Quick lookups and exploration:**
- Use API directly in web browser for small queries
- Test query syntax in browser before implementing in code
- Use summary endpoints for quick statistics
- Leverage filters to narrow results efficiently

### Working with variable documentation

**Access codebooks and data dictionaries:**

1. **API Variables endpoint:**
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/api-variables/
```
Returns all variables with data types, formats, labels, special values

2. **API Endpoint Variables endpoint:**
```
https://educationdata.urban.org/api/v1/api-endpoint-varlist/
```
Returns variables organized by endpoint

3. **Downloadable codebooks:**
- Excel format (XLS) codebooks available for major endpoints
- Access via "Downloads" tab in documentation
- Include variable names, types, labels, value codes

**Understanding special values:**
- `-1` typically indicates missing data
- `-2` typically indicates not applicable
- `-3` may indicate suppressed for privacy
- `-9` sometimes used for "not reported"
- Check endpoint-specific codebooks for exact meanings

**Using labels in R package:**
```r
df <- get_education_data(
  level = "schools",
  source = "ccd",
  topic = "directory",
  add_labels = TRUE  # Adds human-readable labels
)
```

## Data sources and updates

### Federal data sources integrated

The Education Data Portal aggregates and harmonizes data from:

**US Department of Education:**
- Common Core of Data (CCD) - Public K-12 schools and districts
- Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) - Equity and civil rights data
- EdFacts - State assessment and performance data
- Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) - College data
- College Scorecard - Student outcomes and loan repayment

**US Census Bureau:**
- Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) - District poverty data
- National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) - Census data at education institution locations

**Other sources:**
- Federal Student Aid (FSA) - Student loan and grant data
- National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) - Endowment data
- National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS) - IRS Form 990 data
- Campus Crime (Clery Act) - Campus crime statistics
- Equity in Athletics Data (EADA) - Athletic participation

### Data quality considerations

**Known limitations:**

1. **Privacy protections:** Small cell sizes may be suppressed in CRDC and EdFacts data

2. **EdFacts fuzzing:** EdFacts data uses statistical "fuzzing" to protect student privacy, which introduces measurement error in reported values

3. **COVID-19 impacts:**
   - 2019-20 assessment data largely not collected
   - 2020-21 data has participation and quality issues
   - 2020 CRDC data may have collection anomalies

4. **CRDC collection gaps:** Biennial collection means data not available for all years (collected only in odd years: 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2020)

5. **College Scorecard limitations:** Only includes students who received federal financial aid (Title IV); not all students

6. **Identifier stability:** School district boundaries change over time; district IDs may not be perfectly stable across all years

7. **IPEDS branch campuses:** Sometimes aggregated to main campus at OPEID level rather than individual campus (UNITID)

8. **Finance fiscal years:** Finance data uses fiscal year which may differ from academic year

### Data update frequency

The portal is updated as source agencies release new data:
- CCD: Annual updates (typically released in spring for prior year)
- CRDC: Biennial updates (typically 12-18 months after collection year)
- IPEDS: Annual updates by component (fall, spring, winter collections)
- EdFacts: Annual updates (typically fall release for prior year)
- SAIPE: Annual updates (typically released in fall)
- College Scorecard: Annual updates (typically fall release)

Check the metadata endpoints or documentation for current data availability.
